# CAT-MAKER
Simple program that requests and returns cat images . Made for purposes of reviewing.



JUST A QUICK EDIT  #1 TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS CONNECTED


#  everything is connected



# just wrote down basic code to get image from google 



# compiled and worked from first time

THINGS TO DO :
-ask user if he wants more images
-put file in http or something fancy


or move on to next quick thing that will aid in main project


# FINAL THOUGHTS : TOOK ME 40 MINUTES I LOVED IT AND MY LAPTOP AND GITHUB HAVE RANDOM CATS ON THEM NOW
